For bottom-level acceleration structures, the output includes a set of geometry descriptions roughly matching the data used in the original build.  The output is only a rough match for the original in part because of the tolerances allowed in the specification for acceleration structures and in part due to the inherent complexity of reporting exactly the same structure as is conceptually encoded.  For example. axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) returned for procedural primitives could be more conservative (larger) in volume and even different in number than what is actually in the acceleration structure representation.  Geometries, each with its own geometry description, appear in the same order as in the original acceleration, as shader table indexing calculations depend on this.</para>
