The runtime also requires that the left, right, top, and bottom members of any RECT that are used for this format are multiples of 2. This format differs from DXGI_FORMAT_NV12 in that the layout of the data within the resource is completely opaque to applications. Applications cannot use the CPU to map the resource and then access the data within the resource. You cannot use shaders with this format. Because of this behavior, legacy hardware that supports a non-NV12 4:2:0 layout (for example, YV12, and so on) can be used. Also, new hardware that has a 4:2:0 implementation better than NV12 can be used when the application does not need the data to be in a standard layout.</para>

Valid view formats for this video resource format are DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_UNORM and DXGI_FORMAT_R16G16B16A16_UINT. The runtime does not enforce whether the lowest 6 bits are 0 (given that this video resource format is a 10-bit format that uses 16 bits). If required, application shader code would have to enforce this manually.  From the runtime's point of view, DXGI_FORMAT_Y210 is no different than DXGI_FORMAT_Y216. Supported view types are SRV and UAV. One view provides a straightforward mapping of the entire surface. The mapping to the view channel is Y0-&gt;R16, U-&gt;G16, Y1-&gt;B16, and V-&gt;A16.</para>
